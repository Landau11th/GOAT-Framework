# GOAT-Framework

This project is a generic code to do quantum optimal control (QOC) in a way GOAT describes.
It is written in C++ and based on certain linear algebra libraries.
Currently it uses templates from Armadillo, and hopefully supports for Eigen will also be added later.

Intel MKL could be used to boost the performance.
